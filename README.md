# LogViewer_New
This is the updated LogViewer application that I developed for my clients when I was working as a Software Engineer for NuWest Group.

The home screen of the application allows users to open a LogView which contains log entries from one of two sources: tables in a SQL database or .txt log files.

An open LogView appears like this:

Once open, the source(s) of the log entries can be seen and edited on the right and the log entries can be filtered using the options at the top.

Additionally, each log view has two additional settings: the option to automatically refresh the log entries from the sources and the option to highlight new log entries.
